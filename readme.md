I didn't really find too much of this assignment challenging. If anything I wasn't sure if you wanted us to use a javascript engine to create the site or just use javascript functions. I chose to do the latter but if it was the former I would be more than happy to redo this assignment. I did end up making it that no matter what you pick you end up dying cause at the end of the day your choices don't matter too much at the end as you're gonna die anyway. It showcases the illusion of choice.
